Unity Mesh Generation Exploration

This repository is a personal exploration project focusing on mesh generation within Unity 3D. The aim is to delve into the technical aspects of creating various mesh types programmatically, understanding Unity's Mesh class, and exploring efficient ways to generate and manipulate meshes in real-time for game development contexts.

Features:

Programmatic generation of basic to complex mesh types.
Exploration of optimization techniques for real-time applications.
Experiments with different geometries and mesh manipulation strategies.
Objective:
The primary goal is to deepen my understanding of mesh generation in Unity and document the learning process. This repository serves as a reference and a showcase of my journey through mesh generation techniques.

Usage:
While this project is not intended as a development toolkit, fellow developers and technical artists interested in mesh generation are welcome to explore the code, learn from the experiments conducted, and possibly contribute ideas or suggestions.
